                <p class="mb-6 text-neutral-700">This unit introduces the fundamental concepts of wireless and mobile communication, tracing its evolution and outlining the basic architecture of cellular systems. Understanding these basics is crucial for grasping more advanced topics in wireless technology.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600">A. Defining Mobile and Wireless Communication</h3>
                    <p><strong>Wireless communication</strong> is the transmission of information over distances without physical conductors (wires/cables). <strong>Mobile communication</strong> enables communication between individuals in different places without physical connections, using devices like smartphones that connect wirelessly, typically via radio waves.</p>
                    <p>The first commercial mobile telephony began in 1946 (BELL, USA), using a single high-power analog transmitter. "Mobile" often refers to terminals in high-speed platforms (e.g., car phones), while "portable" refers to handheld terminals for walking speeds.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600">B. Evolution of Mobile Radio Communications (0G to 1G)</h3>
                    <p>Mobile communication evolved from early "0G" systems to the first generation (1G) analog cellular systems.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>0G (Pre-cellular):</strong> Early systems like Mobile Telephone Service (MTS) and Improved Mobile Telephone Service (IMTS) in the 1940s-1970s. These used a single, powerful transmitter for wide coverage, but had very limited capacity (e.g., 33 channels for a large area) and no handoff capability, leading to call drops when users moved between zones. Spectrum utilization was highly inefficient.</li>
                        <li><strong>1G (First Generation Cellular System):</strong> Evolved in the early 1980s to address 0G limitations. Introduced the cellular concept.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Examples of 1G Systems:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System):</strong> Launched in 1983 in North America, China, Australia. Analog, FDMA. Bands: 869-894 MHz (BS Tx), 824-849 MHz (Mobile Tx). 30 KHz channel bandwidth, 790 full duplex channels (42 control). FM modulation. Max 3W mobile power.</li>
                        <li><strong>NMT (Nordic Mobile Telephone):</strong> 1981, Nordic countries, Europe.</li>
                        <li><strong>TACS (Total Access Communication System):</strong> 1985, UK.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Limitations of Conventional/1G Systems:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Limited Service Capability:</strong> No handoff; calls dropped on zone change. Fixed channels per zone limited users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Poor Performance:</strong> High call blocking (e.g., NYC 1976). Susceptible to interference, poor voice quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Inefficient Spectrum Utilization:</strong> One channel per user across entire area, leading to spectrum wastage.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Data Communication:</strong> Primarily voice-only.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low Security:</strong> Analog signals easily intercepted.</li>
                        <li><strong>Large Handsets & Short Battery Life:</strong> Impractical for portability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These limitations, coupled with LSI/microprocessor advancements, drove the development of the cellular concept.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>Common Air Interface (CAI)</strong> is the protocol governing MS-BS radio interaction, defining signaling and channel coding for reliability.</p>
                    <p><strong>Channel Types defined by CAI:</strong></p>
                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>FVC (Forward Voice Channel):</strong> BS to MS voice traffic.</li>
                        <li><strong>RVC (Reverse Voice Channel):</strong> MS to BS voice traffic.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>FCC and RCC are known as setup channels, responsible for call initiation. Typically, 5% of channels are for control, 95% for voice/data.</p>

                    <p>WLL replaces traditional wired connections (copper) with wireless radio links for last-mile subscriber access to the central telephone exchange. Cost-effective for rural/hard-to-wire areas.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Architecture:</p>
                    <p>The WLL system typically involves several core components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network):</strong> The global circuit-switched network that forms the backbone of telephony.</li>
                        <li><strong>WANU (Wireless Access Network Unit):</strong> Located at the local exchange or central office, this unit acts as the interface between the central office and multiple subscribers. It includes transceivers for radio signals, a WLL Controller to coordinate communication, and an Access Manager (AM) for subscriber authentication.</li>
                        <li><strong>Switch Function:</strong> Positioned between the PSTN and the WANUs, this component manages call routing and ensures the establishment of communication paths.</li>
                        <li><strong>WASU (Wireless Access Subscriber Unit):</strong> Installed at the subscriber's premises, the WASU connects the end-user to the WANU via radio links and receives local power.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Communication Flow:</p>
                    <p>When a subscriber (WASU) initiates a call, the signal is transmitted wirelessly to the WANU. The WANU then verifies the subscriber through its Access Manager and Home Location Register (HLR). Subsequently, the signal is routed by the Switch Function through the PSTN to the destination.</p>
                    <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> No physical wiring, cost-effectiveness (lower infrastructure and installation costs), quick deployment, enhanced security through digital encryption, high scalability. Supports voice, internet, data, and fax. Offers limited mobility.</p>
                    <p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Susceptible to environmental interference (signals affected by weather and obstructions), potentially lower bandwidth speeds compared to wired systems, limited coverage range, and prone to signal interference from other wireless signals.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600">A. Spectrum Allocation</h3>
                    <p>Spectrum allocation is the designation of specific frequency bands by regulatory bodies (e.g., FCC in U.S., ITU globally) for different wireless services. This process is crucial because radio spectrum is a finite and valuable resource. Efficient allocation prevents harmful interference between different services and maximizes the overall use of the spectrum.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Licensed Bands:</strong> Cellular systems primarily operate in licensed frequency bands, meaning operators pay for exclusive rights to use certain frequencies within a specific geographic area. This ensures predictable service quality and minimizes interference from other users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unlicensed Bands:</strong> Some wireless technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) operate in unlicensed bands (like ISM band), where devices can transmit without individual licenses, but must tolerate interference from other users.</li>
                        <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Proper spectrum allocation is vital for network planning, capacity management, and the overall health and growth of the wireless industry.</li>

                    <p>As covered in Unit 1, the core idea of a cellular system is to divide a large service area into smaller, manageable geographic regions called "cells." Each cell is served by a low-power base station (BS), which handles communication with mobile users within its boundaries. This fundamental concept enables a significant increase in system capacity through a technique called frequency reuse.</p>
                    <p>The Mobile Switching Center (MSC) acts as the central coordinator, managing call processing, billing, and critically, orchestrating "handoffs" as mobile users move seamlessly between adjacent cells. The overall objective of this design is to achieve high communication capacity using a limited radio spectrum, while simultaneously providing coverage over very large geographic areas.</p>

                    <p>Key metrics for evaluating cellular system performance, ensuring a balance between technical efficiency and user satisfaction:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Voice Quality:</strong> This is a subjective assessment of how clear and natural speech sounds. It's often measured using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on a five-point scale (1=Bad, 5=Excellent).
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>CM5 (Excellent):</strong> Speech perfectly understandable, no noticeable noise or distortion.</li>
                                <li><strong>CM4 (Good):</strong> Speech easily understandable, but some background noise or slight distortion may be present.</li>
                                <li>Aim for toll quality (MOS ≥ 4) for commercial systems. Higher quality often means higher system cost.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Service Quality:</strong> This encompasses the availability and reliability of the network.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> The percentage of the geographic area where users can obtain a good signal. Typical targets are 90% in flat terrain and 75% in hilly terrain. Achieving 100% coverage is impractical due to cost, interference management, and irregular terrain. For AMPS, 75% of users should rate voice quality between good and excellent in 90% of the served area (flat terrain). These percentages can be adjusted for different terrain conditions, or lowered by operators for lower-performance, lower-cost systems.</li>
                                <li><strong>Grade of Service (GOS):</strong> A measure of network congestion, defined as the probability of a call being blocked (using the Erlang B model) or delayed (using the Erlang C model). For a new system, a GOS of 0.02 (2% blocking probability) for initiating calls during the busy hour is common. This is an average value, and actual blocking probabilities can vary at individual cell sites, potentially exceeding 2% during periods of heavy traffic. Reducing blocking probability necessitates meticulous system planning and sufficient radio channel availability.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dropped Calls:</strong> The rate of calls that are unintentionally terminated before completion. A high drop rate (e.g., >1%) indicates significant issues with coverage, handoff procedures, or channel availability. Minimizing dropped calls is critical for user satisfaction.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Special Features:</strong> The range of supplementary services offered, such as call forwarding, call waiting, voice stored (VSR) box, automatic roaming, and navigation services. The implementation of these features is often influenced by customers' willingness to pay additional charges.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>System design involves a continuous balance of these criteria with economic considerations. Improving one aspect (e.g., coverage) often impacts others (e.g., cost, interference), making cellular engineering a complex optimization problem.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-teal-600">A. Frequency Reuse</h3>
                    <p>Frequency reuse is a core concept where the same set of frequencies is used in different geographic cells that are sufficiently separated to avoid unacceptable interference. This dramatically increases system capacity by allowing a finite number of channels to serve an almost unlimited number of subscribers.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hexagonal Cells:</strong> Used in analysis due to analytical simplicity, ability to cover an area without gaps/overlaps, and approximation of circular radiation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cluster:</strong> A group of N cells that collectively use the complete set of available frequencies. The cluster is then repeated across the service area.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cluster Size (N):</strong> Critical parameter (typically 4, 7, 12). Smaller N means more clusters for a given area, increasing capacity but also interference.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frequency Reuse Factor (1/N):</strong> Each cell within a cluster is allocated 1/N of the total available channels.</li>
                        <li><strong>Co-channel Cells:</strong> Cells using the same set of frequencies. They must be separated by a minimum distance (D) to control interference. The ratio D/R (where R is cell radius) is related to N by the formula: $D/R = \sqrt{3N}$.</li>
                        <li><strong>Formula for N:</strong> For hexagonal cells, $N = i^2 + ij + j^2$, where $i$ and $j$ are non-negative integers. This formula helps determine valid cluster sizes and locate co-channel cells (cells using the same frequencies) within the cellular layout.</li>
                        <li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Frequency reuse inherently involves a trade-off between capacity (smaller N) and co-channel interference (larger N reduces interference).</li>

                    <p>Handoff (or handover) is the process of transferring an active call or data session from one cell to another, or from one channel to another within the same cell, as a mobile user moves. It is essential for maintaining seamless communication and ensuring call continuity.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Handoff Initiation:</strong> Typically initiated when the signal strength from the serving base station drops below a certain threshold, or when the signal quality degrades (e.g., due to interference).</li>
                        <li><strong>Handoff Decision:</strong> Based on signal strength measurements from the mobile and/or base stations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Types of Handoff Control:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Network-Controlled Handoff (NCHO):</strong> The network (typically the MSC) makes all handoff decisions based on measurements reported by base stations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mobile-Assisted Handoff (MAHO):</strong> The mobile station continuously measures the signal strength of its serving base station and neighboring base stations. It reports these measurements to the network, which then makes the handoff decision. Common in 2G systems like GSM.</li>
                        <li><strong>Mobile-Controlled Handoff (MCHO):</strong> The mobile station itself makes the handoff decision based on its own measurements and initiates the transfer. This is faster as it reduces signaling delay with the network.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Types of Handoff Execution:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hard Handoff:</strong> "Break-before-make." The connection to the old base station is abruptly broken before the connection to the new one is established. There is a brief, imperceptible interruption in communication. This is characteristic of FDMA and TDMA systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Soft Handoff:</strong> "Make-before-break." The mobile station temporarily connects to multiple base stations simultaneously during the transition. The connection to the old base station is only released after a stable connection with the new base station is established. This results in a smoother, more seamless transition with no interruption. It is a key characteristic of CDMA systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-2 text-neutral-700">Effective handoff strategies are vital for maintaining Quality of Service (QoS) and preventing dropped calls in mobile environments. The complexity of handoff increases with smaller cell sizes and higher user mobility.</p>

                    <p>Interference is the primary limiting factor in the performance of cellular radio systems. It can lead to undesirable effects such as crosstalk on voice channels, where subscribers hear background noise from unintended transmissions, and missed or blocked calls on control channels due to errors in digital signaling. Interference tends to be more severe in urban environments due to higher radio frequency (RF) noise floors and a greater density of base stations and mobile devices.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Sources of Interference:</p>

                        <li>Other base stations operating in the same frequency band.</li>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Types of Interference:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Co-channel Interference (CCI):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Arises from signals originating from co-channel cells—those cells that utilize the same set of frequencies.</li>
                                <li>A significant challenge with CCI is that it cannot be mitigated simply by increasing the carrier power of a transmitter, as doing so would simultaneously amplify interference to neighboring co-channel cells.</li>
                                <li>To reduce CCI, co-channel cells must be physically separated by a minimum distance (D) to ensure sufficient isolation through propagation.</li>
                                <li>The <strong>Signal-to-Interference Ratio (S/I or SIR)</strong> is a critical metric for evaluating CCI. For equal transmit power and a path loss exponent (n), SIR is approximately proportional to $R^{-n} / \sum (D_i)^{-n}$, where R is cell radius and $D_i$ is distance to interferer. For six equidistant interferers in the first tier, SIR can be approximated as $(\sqrt{3N})^n / i_0$, where N is the cluster size and $i_0$ is the number of interferers.</li>
                                <li>CCI directly impacts link performance, which in turn dictates the frequency reuse plan and overall system capacity.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Adjacent Channel Interference (ACI):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Results from signals that are spectrally close to the desired signal. It is primarily caused by imperfect receiver filters that allow energy from nearby frequencies to "leak" into the desired passband.</li>
                                <li>A particularly severe manifestation of ACI is the <strong>near-far effect</strong>. This occurs when a nearby adjacent channel transmitter (which could be another mobile or a non-cellular system) is so strong that it effectively "captures" a subscriber's receiver, making it difficult to receive the desired signal from the base station. Alternatively, the near-far effect can occur at the base station when a mobile close to the base station transmits on a channel adjacent to one being used by a weak mobile, causing "bleedover" interference that the base station struggles to discriminate.</li>
                                <li>ACI can be minimized through meticulous filtering and strategic channel assignments. This involves maximizing the frequency separation between channels within a given cell (avoiding the assignment of contiguous frequency bands) and preventing the use of adjacent channels in neighboring cells.</li>

                    <p>In practical cellular and personal communication systems, the transmit power levels of every subscriber unit are continuously regulated by the serving base stations. This ensures that mobile devices transmit only the minimum power necessary to maintain a good quality link on the reverse channel. This power control mechanism offers dual benefits: it extends the battery life of the subscriber unit and significantly reduces the reverse channel S/I across the system. It is particularly crucial for CDMA spread spectrum systems, where all users within every cell share the same radio channel.</p>

                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Trunking Concept:</p>
                    <p>Trunking is a fundamental principle in cellular radio systems that allows a large number of users to share a relatively small pool of channels within a cell. This is achieved by providing on-demand access to a common pool of available channels. When a call concludes, the channel is immediately returned to this pool, making it available for other users. This approach effectively leverages the statistical behavior of users, enabling a fixed number of channels to serve a large, random user community. There exists an inherent trade-off: as the number of available channels decreases, the likelihood of a user encountering all circuits busy during peak calling times increases. In a trunked mobile radio system, if all radio channels are occupied when a user requests service, the user is "blocked" or denied access to the system. Some systems may employ a queue to hold these requests until a channel becomes available.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Definitions in Trunking Theory:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Set-up Time:</strong> The duration required to allocate a trunked radio channel to a requesting user.</li>
                        <li><strong>Blocked Call (Lost Call):</strong> A call that cannot be completed at the time of request due to network congestion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Holding Time (H):</strong> The average duration of a typical call, measured in seconds.</li>
                        <li><strong>Traffic Intensity (A):</strong> A dimensionless measure of channel time utilization, expressed in Erlangs. Traffic intensity per user ($A_u$) is calculated as the call request rate ($\lambda$) multiplied by the holding time ($H$), i.e., $A_u = \lambda H$. The total offered traffic intensity (A) for U users is $A = U A_u$. In a system with C channels, if traffic is equally distributed, the traffic intensity per channel ($A_c$) is $A_c = U A_u / C$.</li>
                        <li><strong>Load:</strong> The total traffic intensity across the entire trunked radio system, measured in Erlangs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Grade of Service (GOS):</strong> A measure of congestion, specified as the probability of a call being blocked (for Erlang B systems) or the probability of a call being delayed beyond a certain amount of time (for Erlang C systems). For instance, the AMPS cellular system is designed for a GOS of 2% blocking, implying that 2 out of 100 calls will be blocked during the busiest hour due to channel occupancy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Request Rate ($\lambda$):</strong> The average number of call requests per unit time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Erlang B Formula (Blocked Calls Cleared):</p>
                    <p>This formula applies to trunked systems that do not provide queuing for call requests. If a channel is unavailable, the user is immediately blocked and may attempt the call again later. The formula assumes Poisson call arrivals, an infinite number of users, memoryless requests (blocked users can request a channel anytime), exponentially distributed channel occupancy, and a finite number of channels. This is known as an M/M/m/m queue. The Erlang B formula determines the probability of a call being blocked: $Pr\{blocking\} = (A^C / C!) / \sum_{k=0}^{C} (A^k / k!) = GOS$, where C is the number of trunked channels and A is the total offered traffic. This formula provides a conservative estimate of GOS.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Erlang C Formula (Blocked Calls Delayed):</p>
                    <p>This formula applies to trunked systems that provide a queue to hold blocked calls. If a channel is not immediately available, the call request is delayed until a channel becomes free. The GOS in this context is defined as the probability that a call is blocked after waiting a specific time in the queue. The probability of a call experiencing an initial delay is given by $Pr[delay>0]=A^C / (A^C + C!(1-A/C)\sum_{k=0}^{C-1} (A^k / k!))$. The probability that a delayed call is forced to wait more than $t$ seconds is $Pr[delay>t]=Pr[delay>0] \times exp(-(C-A)t/H)$. The average delay (D) for all calls in a queued system is $D = Pr[delay>0] \times H / (C-A)$.</p>
                    <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-orange-700 mt-4">Trunking Efficiency:</p>
                    <p>This measures the number of users that can be offered a particular GOS with a specific channel configuration. The way channels are grouped significantly impacts the number of users a trunked system can handle. For example, 10 channels trunked together can support 60% more traffic at a specific GOS than two separate groups of five channels. This highlights that channel allocation in a trunked radio system has a major impact on overall system capacity.</p>

                                <li>Increases frequency reuse and capacity by scaling the geometry of the cellular cluster.</li>
                                <li>For new cells with half the radius of the original, the transmit power must be significantly reduced (e.g., by 12 dB for a path loss exponent $n=4$) to maintain the frequency reuse plan.</li>
                                <li>In practice, not all cells are split simultaneously, leading to the coexistence of different cell sizes. This requires careful channel assignments and sophisticated handoff management, often involving umbrella cells to accommodate high-speed traffic.</li>

                                <li>Replacing a single omnidirectional BS antenna with multiple directional antennas, each covering a specific sector (e.g., three $120^{\circ}$ sectors or six $60^{\circ}$ sectors).</li>

                                <li>Trade-offs: requires more antennas per base station, can decrease trunking efficiency due to the subdivision of the channel pool, and increases the number of handoffs (though modern base stations often support intra-cell sector handoffs without MSC intervention).</li>

                                <li>Multiple zone sites (Tx/Rx units) are connected to a single BS and share the same radio equipment, collectively forming a cell.</li>
                                <li>As a mobile unit moves within this cell, it is served by the zone with the strongest signal but maintains the same channel. The base station dynamically switches the channel to the active zone site, localizing radiation and reducing interference.</li>
                                <li>Significantly reduces the handoff load on the MSC (as no handoffs are required within the cell) and decreases co-channel interference through lower-powered zone transmitters.</li>

                    <p><strong>Principles:</strong> Message signal is multiplied by a wideband pseudo-random spreading code (Pin code). This spreads the signal's bandwidth. At receiver, signal is multiplied by same code to despread desired signal and spread interference. Makes signals robust against interference and jamming.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Processing Gain:</strong> Ratio of spread spectrum bandwidth to original baseband bandwidth ($R_c / R_b$).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Orthogonal Codes:</strong> Codes where product of two distinct codes is zero (e.g., Walsh codes). Product with itself is non-zero. Allows multiple users on same frequency without interference if power controlled, as each signal is uniquely recoverable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Performance Comparison with TDMA:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> CDMA generally higher (N=1 frequency reuse).</li>
                        <li><strong>Interference Management:</strong> CDMA uses codes and power control; TDMA uses time slots/frequency planning.</li>
                        <li><strong>Voice Quality:</strong> CDMA often superior (soft handoff, interference rejection).</li>
                        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> CDMA more complex (stringent power control).</li>

                    <h3 class="2xl font-semibold text-teal-600">G. Advanced Intelligent Networks (AIN)</h3>
                    <p>Advanced Intelligent Networks (AIN) are a telecommunications network architecture that separates service logic from switching equipment, allowing for rapid deployment of new services without hardware changes. While not explicitly detailed as a separate section in the provided notes, the concept of an "Intelligent Cell" (discussed in Unit 4) is a manifestation of AIN principles in the wireless domain.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Idea:</strong> Centralized control and distributed execution. Services are defined in databases (like SCPs in SS7) and executed by switches (SSPs) based on triggers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Relevance to Wireless:</strong> AIN principles enable advanced mobile services like personalized routing, prepaid calling, and complex call features, by making the network more programmable and flexible. The "Intelligent Cell" concept directly applies AIN ideas to optimize radio resource management and handoffs locally.</p>

                    <p>Discussed in Unit 4 (Improving Coverage & Capacity). Aims to reduce MSC handoff load and co-channel interference by using multiple low-power zone transmitters within a cell, all controlled by a single base station. The mobile communicates on the same frequency channel as it moves between zones, with the base station switching the active zone site.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Reduces MSC handoff load, decreases CCI, improves signal quality, increases capacity (e.g., N=7 to N=3 for 2.33x capacity increase).</li>
                        <li><strong>Types:</strong> Power Delivery Intelligent Cell (monitors position, delivers confined power), Processing Gain Intelligent Cell (signals coexist with interference).</li>
